# Superlist

## Description

"Superlist" was a miniproject during an intense 3-months bootcamp on JavaScript. It showcases classified ads and allows users to add additional ones. 
In this miniproject the aim was to create a REST-API back-end server as well as a front-end client to serve it. 
The back-end server offers search functionalities and allows the add action. 
This mini project is a great base to learn REST and add much more functionalities. It is pre-configured to run on localhost, port 3000.
